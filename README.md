100 Days of Machine Learning Coding as proposed by Siraj Raval

## Day 1 : Sep 10 , 2019

**Today's Progress** : I have enrolled in the course of "Python for Data Science!" in edx.org to review my knowledge.
I have completed 3 weeks of this course.

**Thoughts** : It was really easy although I have become surprised because I didn't know some primary techniques!
